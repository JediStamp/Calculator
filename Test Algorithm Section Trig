Math program algorithm 

1. create TriangleSidesScanned class

   scan for all 3 triangle sides where side C is the hyponuese

   Store scanned values into variables

2. create AnglesScanned class

   nest in a WHILE angles =< 90 degree loop

   scan for all 3 angles 

   IF any AngleScanned >= 90 degrees, restart the scanning loop 

3. Calculate unknown side

   use a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
 
   IF input a and b are true 
   Calc for C
   
   .... to be finished
